# Caesar cipher
Welcome to the Caesar Cipher program.

# How to use it
To start, run the program in your preferred environment. Then, press and enter 1 in your keyboard to encrypt a message, and press 2 to decrypt a message. Then, simply enter your message and key number - the number of shifts you want - and your message will be encrypted/decrypted. The program will run until you have hit 3, in which case it will terminate!
